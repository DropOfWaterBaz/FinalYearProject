                <p>ENTPs, also known as Debaters, get their nickname from the fact that they enjoy arguing their opinions. Even if they don't believe in it, they love to play devil's advocate just for the sake of having a conflicting stance. It gives them the chance to exercise their wittiness and knowledge on certain topics. They learn by the way of the nickname - by debating.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Sharpness: Debaters are quick and clever. They know something about everything, often via experience of debates past.</p>
    <p>- Brainstorms: ENTPs can move from idea to idea quickly. They have original ideas which they use to their advantage.  </p>
    <p>- Energy: ENTPs are high-energy people, this coupled with their enthusiasm  makes it easier for them to work long and hard when it is necessary.</p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Lack of Sensitivity: Debaters spend a lot of their time opposing other people's views. This can cause them to be insensitive, and even offensive towards others - including those that they care about. </p>
    <p>- Poor Focus: For the same reason they're great at brainstorming, ENTPs can struggle sticking to one idea or one train of though at a time. Their mind can often start wandering.</p>
    <p>- Intolerant & Argumentative: Given that ENTPs are so strongly opinionated, they can often dismiss not only opposing views but the people who hold them. </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Debaters love to show off their knowledge, which can play to their strength in their careers as they put new ideas on the board which can lead to new opportunities and possibilities.</p>
        <p>ENTPs suit jobs that require creativity and problem-solving. Some careers like engineering or entrepreneurship require these insights from the likes of a debater. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>Debaters are very contrary, however, they don't take these discussions to heart - as long as they stay impersonal. They come from a line of logical thinking and can find it difficult to relate to others when it comes to emotional expression. </p>
