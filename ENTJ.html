                <p>ENTJs or Commanders have charisma and confidence, lending to their ability to bring people together. They are driven and determined, and can be seen as overwhelming to quieter, more sensitive people. They love a good challenge and approach them with optimism.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Confidence: Commanders are very confident in their own ability. This is a large portion of the reason they like a challenge - they believe sooner or later, an obstacle can be overcome and don't get disheartened by the occurence of setbacks. </p>
    <p>- Resilience: Commanders know that just because things get tough, that's no reason to quit. They realise that when things aren't so easy, that's the time to buckle down and get the hands dirty. </p>
    <p>- Efficiency: ENTJs  don't like to waste their time and energy. They see inefficiency as something that only hinders their goals and aspirations.</p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Intolerance: Commanders can sometimes be just that, people who command. They do not always respond well to criticism on their methods and can be quite unsupportive.</p>
    <p>- Arrogance: Although confidence in one's own ability is a good trait to have, ENTJs's arrogance prevents them from considering what are actually better ideas than their own.   </p>
    <p>- Lack of Empathy: Commanders can be impatient when others don't see things the way do, which is something they are guilty of themselves. They can sometimes forget to take the concerns and emotions of others into account, which can leave the people around them upset.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Commanders are very determined and have a great ability help drive others forward. They help others to overcome obstacles and they are excellent communicators. Like in their lives, ENTJs wish to face challenges and overcome them. </p>
        <p>ENTJs are <i>not</i> very compatible with low-level, monotonous jobs. They feel more suited to take on high-ranking occupations where they will be able to take on these challenges. Careers such as an executive, judge or strategy consultants.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>Commanders social skills don't always translate fantastically from their careers to their personal life. Commanders have an authoritative nature and so can make difficult friends - thus the people in their circle should understand how a ENTJ operates. </p>
