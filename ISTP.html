                <p>ISTPs or Virtuosos are unique people. They don't need much external motivation to pursuit their goals, they're own drive is enough. they use their senses to explore ideas and the world around them. They like to be in the thick of it, ready to do the dirty work of their latest projects. They like to dissect things like clocks to see how the inner machinations work. They like when others take interest in their work and are always happy to help others. Virtuosos, although friendly, are quite private which is why they are often considered to be rather enigmatic. They are fair and treat others the way they want to be treated themselves.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Creativity: Because the way like to pull things apart and put them back together again, virtuosos have a unique way of thinking. They tend to have excellent spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills with which they can use in a wide range of real-life situations.</p>
    <p>- Energetic: ISTPs require a lot of energy for their projects and this translate to their social life too. They are enthusiastic about most ideas, letting others make suggestions and simply going with the flow.</p>
    <p>- Crisis Handling: ISTPs have so much hands-on experience across a wide variety of aspects of life that they are almost always prepared to handle an issue should it arise. They don't shy away from a little bit of risk when necessary.</p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Boredom: One of the reasons that virtuosos are always working at something is that they get bored easily. They are great at figuring out things with little information but may lose focus if something lasts for too long.</p>
    <p>- Risk: Not afraid of risk-taking and trying new things, ISTPs  </p>
    <p>- Commitment: Because they get bored easily, ISTPs can worry about making a commitment in case they lose interest halfway through. They like to take things one day at a time and worry about getting trapped into having to do something.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Virtuosos love to know the ins-and-outs, unseen functions and the gears and cogs that make something work. Their brilliant spatial reasoning skills allows them to work in fields that simply wouldn't suit others at all. However, virtuosos themselves don't suit all occupations. They want to see their work in action, and for example something like theoretical physics doesn't intrigue them all too much.</p>
        <p>For this reason, a career as an engineer, mechanic or carpenter to name a few would be well suited to ISTPs.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>Virtuosos have such a wide range of experience that it's easy for them to relate to others and be relatable. Although easy-going, virtuosos have problems with commitment, which can be a major issue in both friendships and romantic relationships. Saying no to such commitments may make others feel unwanted. They don't like to be restricted to plans. Being quite private about personal matters, there are few that truly get an insight to an ISTP. They like to enjoy friendly competition with their peers.
