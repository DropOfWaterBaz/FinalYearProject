                <p> ISTJs or Logisticians (not to be confused with the Logician personality) have a rational perspective on reality. They are very deliberate in their actions and waste no time on the task at hand. Logisticians are not the type to leave work to the last minute, and will become irritable if they do so. They use facts and clear information to come to their conclusions and to make their decisions. They trust their self-reliance more than that of others.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Responsibility: Logisticians are reliable people and stick to their word. They do what needs to be done and don't laze around. They would rather work to the point of self-exhaustion than fail to deliver.</p>
    <p>- All-rounders: ISTJs have a great capacity to retain information on a wide range of topics. Coupled with their ability to pick things up quickly, they are able to be of use in almost all situations. </p>
    <p>- Attention to Detail: If a logistician has to do something, they make sure they get it done right. They don't cut corners and can be relied on to perfect each facet of what they do to the best of their ability. </p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Obedience to Rules: Though there is nothing wrong with being respectful of rules, ISTJs make take this too far. They refuse to do anything that could even be <i>perceived</i> as breaking the rules. This can result in a lack of innovation and originality </p>
    <p>- Judgemental: As logisticians see the world mostly through rationale, they can be quick to dismiss those with opposite opinions to them. This stubbornness can make them close-minded and have a lack of respect for those with different perspectives.</p>
    <p>- Insensitivity: As they communicate via facts and information, ISTJs can often miss the chance to be tactful with their words. They don't always consider the feelings of others when they say something, which can upset their loved ones or cause conflict to arise.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Logisticians seek professional stability, they tend to lean away from freelance or consultancy work. Traditionalists themselves, may ISTJs find themselves winding up in long-established institutions such as law enforcement, the military and other roles in which they feel they can contribute to society as a whole. </p>
        <p>Of course, these are not the only desires of ISTJs in their career. They like to work in a position that they can use their knowledge and there isn't too may abstract aspects of the job - such roles may be as an accountant, in administration or data analysts.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>Logisticians are not the type to plan a random adventure with their social circle. Not to say they aren't fun, but they like to know in advance if there are any events upcoming and don't tend to do things on a whim. They can be slow to make friends, treading carefully, but this means that those that they do form relationships with have their loyalty and trust. They aren't the most emotionally formidable, but they express them through what they do and not what they say. They enjoy the company of extraverts as they can fill most of the conversation and the burden to make chat isn't on them. They don't like getting into conflict and this is a reason that many people they surround themselves with have similar principles and opinions.</p>
