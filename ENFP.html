                <p>ENFPs or "Campaigners" are known to be some of the most charismatic and lively of people. They are kind and idealistic people-pleasers. ENFPs see life as a big puzzle - a puzzle of emotion and deeper meaning as opposed to merely a series of factual jigsaw pieces. They don't take things at face value and aren't afraid to question authority.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>-Curiosity: ENFPs like to experience new things, explore the unknown and learn</p>
    <p>-Observation: Everything is relevant. Campaigners believe that any small action can effect the outcome in a significant way.</p>
    <p>-Social Skills: ENFPs tend to be highly social. As a result, they are great communicators, know a wide range of people and are quite enthusiastic. </p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>-Highly Emotional: Emotions are what make us human. However, Campaigners can have mood swings or be prone to stress as a result. </p>
    <p>-Overthinking: As they tend to look into the deeper meaning of situations, ENFPs can tend to find issues that aern't necessarily there. To them, there is more often more than meets the eye to a situation, but they're not always right. This can result lead to worrying about issues that may not exist.</p>
    <p>-Poor Concentration: This can also be considered to be the downfall of the ENFP's curiosity. They like to think about possibilities and things that mystify them - something not all too helpful when there's a deadline at midnight tonight.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Campaigners tend to prefer a "laissez-faire" type fo career, meaning that they tend to like jobs in which they have freedom to be creative and can express their ideas. They are explorers, who want to push the boundaries in both their personal <i>and</i> professional lives. Repetitive jobs do not suit ENFPs - they want variation and to try new things. </p>
        <p>A career like journalism, reporting, or even theatre and acting in the media industry may satisfy the desire of ENFPs to discover interesting things and avoid monotony.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>Due to their social nature and deep-thinking, ENFPs can get quite involved in the lives of others, and are prone to putting others ahead of themselves. The love they have for their friends, family and partners can also have its consequences. They're idealistic way of thinking can be a cause for naivety - expecting the best from people in a world where life is often unfair. This may cause strain in a relationship when they find out the other person may not be as perfect as they had hoped. </p>
