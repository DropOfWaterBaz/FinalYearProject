                <p>INTPs or Logicians are curious and have a very creative imagination. They tend to lose themselves in their daydreams and get tired easily from socialising. They are high-energy introverts and connect well with those who match their mental energy.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Objectivity: Logicians primary goal is the truth. They look deeper into things and want to find out about any underlying realities. This means that they are a good control and are very honest.</p>
    <p>- Interesting: INTPs have a large foundation of knowledge and can make great conversation about wide variety of interesting topics. </p>
    <p>- Open-Mindedness: In search of the truth, INTPs are accepting of different ideas, insights and methods as long as they are back-up by good reasoning.</p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Social Unawareness: As they let their minds wander so often, INTPs can also let this happen when in social situations. This can leave the people with them feeling ignored and unheard.</p>
    <p>- Perfectionism: Logicians spend a lot of time about what could be better. This can apply a lot to their personal ideals but also to their work, which can lead to them finding themselves frustrated.</p>
    <p>- Impatience: When speaking about their ideas or thoughts, INTPs have a tendency to get frustrated when others can't keep up with a topic and may dismiss the person they're talking to.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Logicians are exploratory people. They like to delve into a project and figure out how to overcome the obstacles that come with it. They can understand intricate and complex systems.  </p>
        <p>Although they don't have bad people-skills, logicians may prefer less customer-oriented positions. They are innovative and like structure in their work. As they can recognise multiple opportunities and foresee problems, a career in a planning position such a corporate strategist would be well-suited to an INTP.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>As logicians quite like their time alone, they are quite selective about who they <i>do</i> spend their time with. They tend to become friends with people who share their love for new theories and riddles. They are not against having people challenge their ideas, however.</p>
