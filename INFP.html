                <p>INFPs or Mediators are quiet but open-minded people. They are imaginative and creative. This creative energy is funnelled into their personal lives (as opposed to their social life). Mediators can sometimes feel lonely and as they tend not to have a large circle of friends, they look for deeper and more meaningful relationships.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Creativity: INFPs are no stranger to letting their mind wander. This and their strong imagination allows them to look at problems from a unique perspective, they have great lateral-thinking skills.</p>
    <p>- Open-Mindedness: Mediators are tolerant people. They don't look for fault in people and they tend to be accepting of other people's views. They hold themselves to a (often unrealistic) high standard and so are understanding when others make a mistake or who have done wrong in the past.</p>
    <p>- Generosity: INFPs are unselfish, and when something good works out for them, they are happy to share the happiness. However, this is a double-edged sword as it </p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Lack of Realism: INFPs are idealistic, and so it is difficult for them to accept a world that is anything other than ideal. It can result in having a perception of reality through a "rose-tinted" lens.
    </p>
    <p>- Loneliness: Mediators yearn for deep emotional connection. However, they can have a tough time finding the ability and words to connect to others, which can end up in them feeling alone.</p>
    <p>- Self-Criticism: Mediators may often be overly-critical of themselves. They struggle to live up to the idealistic expectations that they set for themselves, which has detrimental effect on their self-esteem.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">                  
        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Mediators are artistic and free-flowing people. As they spend so much time in their inside world, they love self-expression. There is no perfect job, not something that the idealistic INFPs want to hear. They suit low-stress, low drama occupations that don't get too hectic.</p>
        <p>With these points in mind and INFPs like to work at their own pace, a career in some sort of writing - biographical, poetic or even a prose narrative.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>Mediators often find themselves in the following predicament - they love their time by themselves but can feel lonely when they get it. They want to be well-liked, but often worry about putting their true selves out their. They also don't want to pretend to be someone else in order to be well-liked. For this reason, they flourish in the company of close, meaningful relationships.
