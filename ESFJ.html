                <p>ESFJs or Consuls are typically very popular people. Both as a cause and as an effect of this, they are extremely social. They are the kind of people to host an event and make sure everyone is included and having a good time. Consuls don't care much for the the things they feel they can't control like foreign politics but have more interest in the latest social happenings. Nearby events and new trends in fashion are more to their liking. However, this is not to say they are superficial. They believe that they have a moral duty to do the right thing for others.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
    </h2>
    <u>Strengths</u>
    <p>- Loyalty: Consuls love their friends and family and would do anything for them. They are very trustworthy as that's what they expect from others - they value personal security.</p>
    <p>- Sensitivity to Others: Kind and caring, ESFJs make sure that everyone gets along and they make sure not to hurt anyone's feelings. 
    <p>- Reliability: Consuls feel that they are obliged to stick to their arrangements. If they make plans to go somewhere with a friend, they'll make sure that they're there.</p>

    <u>Weaknesses</u>
    <p>- Social Anxiety: A lot of consuls place too much emphasis on their social status. They can care too much whether people like them or not - it could be said that this reason is the source of their above strengths. </p>
    <p>- Overly Critical: ESFJs don't like things going against the status quo. They can be close-minded against things that are socially uncommon such as unusual styles or behaviours.  </p>
    <p>- Self Expression: Just as ESFJs are critical of others, one of their greatest fears are that others will be critical of them. For this reason, they don't tend to fully express themselves in case someone thinks they come across a bit strange or abnormal.</p>

        <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Consuls make good leaders. They ensure that the peace is kept and they are well-organised. As long as they have some sort of social life within their profession, repetitive tasks don't bother them. They do what's asked of them and it keeps them in a routine. </p>
        <p>Administrative roles suit consuls well. Social interaction is the main aspect if their job and it keeps them busy. They are practical and stay satisfied by keeping their colleagues and customers happy.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">           
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>       
        <p>ESFJs tend to have wide social circles. They're easy to get along with and strive to be good friends. They don't idn putting work into their relationships because it doesn't feel like work to them, just time well-spent. They put their close ones on a pedestal, but this can lead to consuls expecting too much from them and getting needy.</p>
